## Idle Slayer Clone

**Project description:** 
Project I made for a client on the upwork website, basically a copy of the Idle Slayer game with all its mechanics (idle system, quest system, craft system, skill tree, upgrades, save system, etc...).
At the end of the development, the client decided to put the project on hold and the graphics were not updated.

**Status:** 
On hold
